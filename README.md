megaman-ios
===========

An 8bit [Megaman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man) game for iOS, using [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html) and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). The idea is to study iOS new technologies doing something fun =D

Oh, and don't forget: Megaman (Rockman, in japanese) is copyrighted by [Capcom](http://www.capcom.com/), so don't go full retard thinking you can earn money with it.
